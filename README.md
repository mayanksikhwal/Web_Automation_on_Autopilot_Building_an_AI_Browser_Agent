# Web_Automation_on_Autopilot_Building_an_AI_Browser_Agent

## Project Description
This project explores the concept and practical application of AI Browser Agents using the `browser-use` library. It demonstrates how these agents, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) and browser automation, can perform web-based tasks autonomously by understanding high-level natural language goals. The notebook covers the foundational ideas behind browser agents, contrasts them with traditional web automation, explains their architecture and capabilities, provides installation instructions for `browser-use` and its dependencies, and includes code examples for basic search, form filling, data extraction, and multi-step tasks.

## Tech Stack
*   **Python:** The primary programming language used for developing and running the browser agents.
*   **Browser-Use:** The core Python library that simplifies the creation and execution of AI browser agents.
*   **Playwright:** The underlying browser automation framework used by `browser-use` to interact with web pages.
*   **Python-dotenv:** Used for loading environment variables, specifically the API key for the LLM.
*   **Asyncio:** Python's library for writing concurrent code, used for running asynchronous browser operations.
*   **Google Gemini API (or other LLMs):** The Large Language Model that serves as the "brain" of the agent, interpreting tasks and planning actions.
*   **Google Colab:** The environment where this notebook is presented, though local execution is recommended for browser automation tasks.

## How to Run
1.  **Clone or download the project files:** Obtain the notebook file (`.ipynb`) from the repository.
2.  **Open the notebook in Google Colab or your local Jupyter environment.**
3.  **Install Libraries:** Run the installation commands to install `browser-use`, `playwright`, and `python-dotenv`. If running locally, it's recommended to do this in a virtual environment.
